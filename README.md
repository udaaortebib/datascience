        Exploration and analysis of prices and variation of prices between different neighborhoods of Boston.

Motivation:
This project is a part of my Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree program. I chose to work with Airbnb data from Boston. I was interested in exploring and analyzing prices of AirBnB listings and how they vary depending on neighborhood. Furthermore, I was interested to explore how difference in price was reflected through the year.


Summary of results:
The first part of the analysis, regarding prices and variation between neighborhoods, data suggests that location is important to the listing price level. Looking further into listings it also revealed that the quantity in one neighbourhood is not related to the price.

On the other hand, trying to find if price fluctuate throughout the year, I have seen that the database is wrong as it only has dates in the future. Even so, we can see that it is stable throughout the year except for 5 specific dates that should be investigated.
